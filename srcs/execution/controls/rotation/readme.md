# Rotation Matrix in 2D

Sure! In 2D, you can rotate a point (x, y) around the origin by an angle θ in the counterclockwise direction using the following formula:

x' = xcos(θ) - ysin(θ)

y' = xsin(θ) + ycos(θ)

where (x', y') are the new coordinates of the point after rotation. The formula works by using the trigonometric functions cosine and sine to transform the original coordinates of the point into new coordinates that correspond to a rotation around the origin.
