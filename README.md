Cub3d is a 3D game engine developed in C programming language that allows us to create and play simple 3D games. The engine utilizes the Ray-Casting rendering technique to create a 3D perspective projection of the game world. Users can design their game maps using a simple text file format and the engine renders the map in real-time, allowing players to explore and interact with the game environment.

# Instructions
- `WASD` to move
- `Space` & `Right Click Mouse` to shoot
- `Right/Left` & `Right Click Mouse` to change the view
- `R` to reload the ammo
- `F` to close and open the door
- `ESC` to quit

The game will work only for MacOS for now and you should have 1.
